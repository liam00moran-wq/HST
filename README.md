# HST
Repo for space detector lab HST assignment

Tried using some of the methods we learned in our labs, but ran into multiple errors straight away.
Found the package PHOTutils and it made everything more streamlined and easy to understand.
Hopefully this isnt an issue since it is a readily available library



Since i used this library, the gauss fitting regime was not needed and so there is no csv file with parameters.
photutils does use gauss fitting to find the stars, but with loose parameters so i didnt feel the need to save these.
